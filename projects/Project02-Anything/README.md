This game is my submission for Project 02: Anything in Pippin Barr's CART 253. 

The goal of this project was to experiment with classes, arrays, and various functions which intrigued me such as the randomGaussian() function. The main experiment is of course with randomized sections that still progress to an eventual end, though given the scope I only managed to complete variation for the first section, with two possible scenes. I also had to cut off the progression after the third scene, given time restraints and the many hours it took me to create individual scenes.

This project is one I'll likely revisit, probably in the summertime once I've acquired more coding knowledge, but mainly when I'll have completed some other projects that I want to make first.

While I made the images, the music is taken from elsewhere and thus credited to the artists. You can find dthe musicCredits.txt file in the assets/sounds/sectionmusic directory. (I highly recommend SRB2 for fans of platformers, the developers are lovely people and it has a great community)

My goal with this project was to create a fun game, and while I ended up with what I believe is a very enjoyable prototype, I hope it alaso conveys my rationale in programming and my general workflow of experimenting with functions to create something weird or different.

Thanks to Pippin and Dana for helping me with ironing out the numerous kinks that come with using class based programming!
